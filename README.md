# AITrainDAO Smart Contract

## Overview
AITrainDAO is a Clarity smart contract for managing AI model training, staking, and ownership on the Stacks blockchain. The contract enables decentralized AI training coordination and model ownership transfer.

## Features
- AI training job management
- Staking mechanism for training participation
- Compute power tracking and rewards
- AI model ownership and transfer system
- Token-based incentive structure

## Contract Functions

### Training Management
```clarity
(define-public (start-training (job-id uint) (stake-amount uint))
```
Initiates a training job with required stake amount.
- **Parameters:**
  - `job-id`: Unique identifier for the training job
  - `stake-amount`: Amount of tokens to stake
- **Returns:** Response of uint

### Training Completion
```clarity
(define-public (complete-training (job-id uint) (compute-power uint))
```
Completes a training job and mints rewards based on compute power.
- **Parameters:**
  - `job-id`: ID of the completed training job
  - `compute-power`: Amount of compute power contributed
- **Returns:** Response of uint

### Model Management
```clarity
(define-public (transfer-ai-model (model-id uint) (recipient principal))
```
Transfers ownership of an AI model to another address.
- **Parameters:**
  - `model-id`: Unique identifier of the AI model
  - `recipient`: Principal address of the new owner
- **Returns:** Response of bool

## Error Codes
| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| u100 | Invalid job ID |
| u101 | Invalid stake amount |
| u102 | Transfer failed |
| u103 | Invalid compute power |
| u104 | Mint operation failed |
| u105 | Invalid model ID |
| u106 | Invalid recipient |

## Development Setup
1. Install Clarinet
```bash
curl -L https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet/releases/download/v1.0.0/clarinet-windows-x64.msi -o clarinet.msi
```
2. Deploy contract
```bash
clarinet deploy
```

## Testing
Run the test suite:
```bash
clarinet test
```

## Security Considerations
- All inputs are validated
- Ownership verification before transfers
- Protected against zero-value operations
- Type-safe response handling
- Standardized error management
